extra_instructions = """
- 1. CRITICAL: In newly added or modified lines, reject any PR that introduces direct "System.exit()" calls.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: Direct access to 'System.exit()' is forbidden. Applying this to new or changed code prevents new violations.
  Required Action: Developers mustn't use 'System.exit()'.
  When detected: Provide specific line references in the MR's changes where violations occur and include the following text in any remediation advice for this violation type: "'System.exit()' call is not allowed."

- 2. CRITICAL: Reject any PR if the changes introduced result in unused imports within the modified files.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: Unused imports, potentially introduced or left over by the changes in this MR, can cause failure in the build jar phase.
  Required Action: Review the files changed in this MR and remove all unused imports. This must be resolved before the MR can be closed.
  When detected: List all unused imports found in files modified by this MR and state: "Unused imports detected in the changed files. Please remove them. This must be resolved before the MR can be closed."

- 3. IMPORTANT: All new methods should have java doc comment.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: To keep clean and human readable and understandable java class and methods.
  Required Action: If a new class or method is added, first consider if java doc is added or not and check if it could be enhanced. If java doc doesn't exists then suggest one.
  When detected: Identify any missing java doc or doc needs to be updated within this MR and include the following text: "Document update required in this MR: [path_to_new_file(s)]. As per our guidelines, we need to have java doc comments for each class and method."

- 4. CRITICAL: If newly added lines of code introduce significant code duplication or boilerplate, this must be refactored.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: To prevent the introduction of new duplication in our code base, improve maintainability, and reduce boilerplate, making the codebase cleaner and more efficient. This rule focuses on duplication introduced by the current MR.
  Required Action: Identify and refactor clearly duplicated code or extensive boilerplate that has been introduced by the new lines in this MR. This must be resolved before the MR can be closed.
  When detected: Provide specific locations (file paths and line numbers of the newly added code) where significant code duplication or boilerplate is identified as being introduced by this MR. Include the following text: "Significant code duplication or extensive boilerplate appears to be introduced by the new code at [location(s)]. This code should be refactored into reusable components to improve maintainability. This is a blocking item and must be resolved before the MR can be closed."

- 5. MEDIUM: MR descriptions should be comprehensive.
  Importance: MEDIUM.
  Rationale: A detailed MR description aids reviewers in understanding the changes, and any related context, speeding up the review process.
  Required Action: Ensure the MR description clearly outlines:
    - The purpose of the changes.
    - The flow/scenarios covered, especially for API or complex logic changes.
    - Any related changes or dependencies (e.g., other MRs, backend changes).
  When detected: If the MR description appears to lack detail in these areas, state: "The MR description could be more detailed. Please ensure it clearly describes the flow/scenarios and any related changes or dependencies. This helps reviewers understand the context more quickly."

- 6. MEDIUM: Methods should be clear, conventional, and adhere to Single Responsibility.
  Importance: MEDIUM.
  Rationale: Clear method signatures, names, and descriptions, combined with adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), lead to code that is more readable, maintainable, and reusable. Methods should have one primary reason to change.
  Required Action: For newly added or significantly modified methods:
    - Single Responsibility:
        - Each method should have a single, well-defined intention or responsibility. Avoid methods with complex logic that couple multiple distinct intentions (e.g., navigating to a page AND then performing assertions on that page's content; fetching data AND then transforming it AND then saving it).
        - If a method performs multiple distinct types of significant operations, it's a strong indicator it should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods. This improves reusability and maintainability.
    - Naming and Descriptions:
        - Method names should accurately reflect this single, primary action. Names starting with "get" should primarily be simple accessors. If they perform complex logic, mutations, or API calls (even if a single responsibility), use a more descriptive verb (e.g., "fetchUserData", "calculateTotalAmount", "buildQueryParameters").
        - Method descriptions (JavaDoc) must clearly explain the method's single purpose, any significant side-effects, and the meaning of its parameters and return value. The JavaDoc should be consistent with the method's implementation.
    - Parameter Conventions:
        - Avoid using leading underscores (_) as a prefix for parameter names; follow standard Java naming conventions.
        - Parameter names should be descriptive of their purpose and expected values (e.g., avoid vague names like "first", "flag").
        - For boolean parameters, ensure their meaning (true vs. false) is clear, either by name or through JavaDoc comments.
        - Order parameters intuitively: mandatory parameters (like IDs) first, followed by query/filter parameters, then options like result size.
  When detected: If new or modified methods exhibit these issues, point to the specific method and parameter(s) and state: "Review method [method_name] for clarity, naming, and Single Responsibility:
    - Does this method have a single, clear intention? It appears to [describe observed multiple intentions, e.g., 'handle navigation and also perform assertions']. Consider splitting it into smaller, more focused methods to improve reusability and maintainability.
    - Ensure the method name accurately reflects its primary action. Is 'get' appropriate if it's not a simple accessor?
    - Verify the JavaDoc is comprehensive, accurate, and clearly explains parameters and the method's single purpose.
    - Check parameter names for leading underscores or vagueness.
    - Ensure boolean parameters are self-explanatory or documented.
    - Verify parameter order for intuitiveness (mandatory, query, options).
    Example: 'Method navigateToUserDetailsAndVerifyData() couples navigation with assertion. Consider splitting into navigateToUserDetails() and a separate verifyUserDetailsData() method.'"

- 7. MEDIUM: Method names should be descriptive yet concise.
  Importance: MEDIUM.
  Rationale: Long and vague method names can hinder readability and understanding of the code's intent.
  Required Action: For newly added or modified methods, strive for names that clearly indicate what the method does and what data it might return/operate on, without being overly verbose.
  When detected: If a new or modified method name seems excessively long or its purpose isn't immediately clear from the name (e.g., getTotalIssuesCountForTestUsingFindingsAPI, getIssuesDataUsingFindingsAPI), state: "The method name [method_name] seems long or its exact purpose/return isn't immediately obvious. Consider if it can be made more concise or clearer. For example, is 'UsingFindingsAPI' necessary in the name if it's clear from the class context?"

- 8. HIGH: Ensure enough test coverage in report-service for lines of changes.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: Using Claude to suggest more tests for the line of code changed.
  Required Action: If we find any line of code which has missing test coverage then suggest the test cases to add in the MR.
  When detected: If a code has missing test coverage then Suggest to add missing tests in the MR"

- 9. LOW: Method names should be descriptive but concise.
  Importance: LOW.
  Rationale: Very long method names can be cumbersome.
  Required Action: For newly added methods, aim for descriptive names that clearly indicate the method's purpose without being excessively wordy. Consider if parts of the name are implied by the class or if abbreviations can be used if well-understood.
  When detected: If a new method name is very long (e.g., VerifyCodeExclusionsAtAppLevelAsOrgAppMgr), state: "The method name [method_name] is quite long. Consider if it can be shortened while retaining clarity (e.g., 'VerifyAppLevelCodeExclusionsAsOrgAppMgr' or if context implies 'AsOrgAppMgr')."

- 10. HIGH: Promote reuse of common logic.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: Duplicating logic across similar java files and methods (e.g., for different methods but similar core actions) increases maintenance overhead and risk of inconsistencies.
  Required Action: When adding or modifying methods that share significant common flow or setup with existing lines of code, identify common logic and refactor it into reusable helper methods or base classes.
  When detected: If new/modified methods appear to duplicate significant logic from other methods, state: "The new/modified method(s) [list_of_methods] seem to share common logic. Consider refactoring this common logic into reusable helper methods or a base class to reduce duplication and improve maintainability."

- 11. HIGH: Suggest better quality codes.
  Importance: HIGH.
  Rationale: For any new or existing java classes and methods suggest better code quality.
  Required Action: When adding or modifying methods/java classes suggest better code quality, state: "You can improve the quality of the code.".
  When detected: When adding or modifying methods/java classes suggest better code quality, state: "You can improve the quality of the code."
